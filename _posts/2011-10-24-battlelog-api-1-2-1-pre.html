<p>I made a few quick changes that should help those of you who are running versions of PHP less than 5.3.Â Specifically, the ternary operator (without the middle parameter) and <code>DateTime::setTimestamp()</code> were causing problems.</p>
<p>Since I don't have any servers running anything older than PHP 5.3.0, I'll need you guys to point out any further problem areas. Maybe I'll see if I can find an old server I can throw PHP 5.2 on for testing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to head over to the <a title="BattlelogApi" href="http://www.blakeharley.com/projects/battlelogapi/">project page</a> and grab the latest copy.</p>
