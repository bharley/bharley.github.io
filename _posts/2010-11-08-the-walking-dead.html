<p>As a zombie fanatic, a show called <em>The Walking Dead</em> would obviously pique my interest. <em>The Walking Dead</em>, a television series on AMC about zombies and a post-apocalyptic world, is the first time—to my knowledge—that the zombie genre has been made for television.</p>
<p>After discovering it yesterday evening, I immediately watched the first (and only) two episodes. Although I never read the comics this show is based on, I'm enjoying what's been shown so far.</p>
<p>The show itself is your standard zombie affair, and it doesn't deviate too much from the lore laid down by heavy-hitters like George A. Ramero. However, that's the way I like my zombies.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of zombies, I highly suggest you check it out.</p>
