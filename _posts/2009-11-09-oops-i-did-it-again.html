<p>That's right folks, I went and redesigned the website again.</p>
<p>Not that anyone is keeping score, but this is theÂ <strong>23rd</strong> version of my personal website, and it is the 7th version to reside on this domain. That may sound like a lot, but my first website went up in 2003. Which means, on average, I redesign my website a little less then 4 times a year.</p>
<p>Ok, maybe that is a lot.</p>
<p>Instead of making a whole bunch of new promises (like making every link work before I redesign the site again), I'm just going to end this entry right here.</p>
