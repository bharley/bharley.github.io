<p>That's right. I've gone and redesigned the website once again. Why? A combination of factors led to this decision. My free web host was abysmally slow, so I moved the web site on to a server I wasn't using. Additionally, spam bots had all but destroyed the comment system. I know neither of those are very good reasons for completely redesigning a web site, but that's beside the point.</p>
<p>I'm also going to make some more promises. Hopefully they won't be empty promises this time. I plan to post more and actually make those other links at the top do stuff.</p>
<p>I'm setting my sights high with that last promise.</p>
