<p>I've added an "Apps" page for small webapps. Check out the (small) list of webapps. Who knows, you might find one of them useful. I plan to add a few more apps later, but it's nice to get the architecture in place with a few already launched. There are currently two apps: <a href="http://www.blakeharley.com/apps/md5.php">str2md5</a> converts a given string to MD5, and <a href="http://www.blakeharley.com/apps/steamid.php">Steam ID and Community ID</a> is a useful tool for finding IDs that Steam uses if you have one of the other. Great for server admins who want to ban previous players found in the playerlist.</p>
