<p>I still can't decide on the title yet, but the product is near completion: BlakeTV (or BlakeHarleyTv or BlakeHarley(Tv) or whatever). I welcome anyone and everyone to give it a try.</p>
<p>What is BlakeTV? I'm glad you asked! BlakeTV is a website that allows you to follow your favorite TV shows, so you never miss an episode. Simply create an account and add TV shows to your watchlist.</p>
<p>I'm still working on adding a few features, but the basic concept is in complete working order. Later this week I will finish the feed system. I'm also planning on adding some social features in the near future (sharing lists and shows, etc) in addition to further notification systems (email, SMS, etc).</p>
