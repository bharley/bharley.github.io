<p>It looks like Battlelog has gone public and there are already a number of servers up and running. Unfortunately, the game does not unlock here for another 10 hours or so.</p>
<p>It seems EA updated the authentication system slightly. This caused the API to not get proper credentials when logging into Battlelog. Fortunately, the fix was relatively painless. The image locations on the Battlelog CDN have also changed slightly, and those helper methods have been updated accordingly.</p>
<p>This is simply a bugfix release, but I plan to explore Co-op and other additions to the API when I actually have access to Battlefield 3. (<em>Oh looky, longest headshot is actually being recorded now!</em>)</p>
<p>Head over to the <a title="BattlelogApi" href="http://www.blakeharley.com/projects/battlelogapi/">project page</a> to see the specifics and download the updated API.</p>
