<p>In a rather stunning turn of events, I have managed to completely rewrite BlakeTV in under 3 days. After professing my love of <a title="Frameworks and HTML5" href="http://www.blakeharley.com/2011/06/frameworks-and-html5/">frameworks</a>, I decided that it was time to start using them in my personal projects more often. Specifically, Zend Framework. Transferring and fixing up an old project seemed like the best way to focus on the setup of Zend Framework and less on the project itself. Which is not to say I didn't put any effort into the rewriting of BlakeTV---because I did. Besides a massive amount of bug squashing, the core API code didn't change a whole lot. This allowed me to focus on creating a personal Zend Framework toolset that can I can use between all of my Zend Framework projects in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to moving over to Zend Framework, I'm going to start logging all major and some minor changes to BlakeTV. I'll also be tracking a rough version number.</p>
