<p>If you're in love with the stupid doge meme as much as I am, you're going to watch to be greeted by it every time you launch your shell. Right? Well I know I do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/thiderman/doge">doge python script</a></li>
<li>Add <code>doge</code> to the end of your <strong>.bash_rc</strong>/<strong>.bash_profile</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have the internet's favorite meme annoying you every time you try to get anything done.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> He's even in the <a title="Very Christmas. Much Holiday. Wow." href="http://www.blakeharley.com/2013/12/very-christmas-much-holiday-wow/">holiday spirit</a>.</p>
