According to the <a href="http://www.toolband.com/news/letter/index.php?t=1&amp;id=59">Tool newsletter for this month</a>, Tool is going to be releasing their new album in May!</p>
<p>Wait, May? Doesn't that mean they only have a few days left to release their untitled album? Oh nevermind. That newsletter says May of <strong>2012</strong>. That's okay. I've only been waiting for this album for a few years now.</p>
<p>Looking on the bright side, I'll have a few months to enjoy it before the world ends in December of the same year.</p>
