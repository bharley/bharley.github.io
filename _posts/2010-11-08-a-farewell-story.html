<p>After playing (read: botting) retail Lineage 2 for roughly two years and subsequently getting banned (on more than one occasion), I've decided to quit the MMO that has held my life hostage since 2005 (note: there is no time discrepancy there—I played private servers until 2008 when I decided to spring money on the actual game).</p>
<p>Aside from a month spent on Aion and numerous trial accounts for otther MMOs, my MMO experience has been rather lacking in diversity. Even though I had spent the previous five years of my life mocking World of Warcraft, I found myself seriously considering it as a replacement for Lineage 2 simply because of the casual factor. It was the part of World of Warcraft that I despised years ago that led me to picking the game up: the fact that I could spend less than 100 hours a week on it and make notable progress.</p>
<p>Currently, my account is a week old, and I'm only level 28. There are a lot of things I don't like and things I do like. My roommate and I are taking it slowly. We're casually playing our way through dungeons and quests and having a blast. We'll see in a month's time if I stick with this.</p>
<p>Wow. I never thought I'd see the day I'd actually be playing World of Warcraft.</p>
