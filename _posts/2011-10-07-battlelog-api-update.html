<p>As suggested by <a href="http://www.blakeharley.com/2011/10/battlelog-php-api/#comment-52">Luiz</a>, I have added a method to grab a user's friends list. It returns their online status and whether or not they're in a game. Additionally, if they're in a Battlefield 3 server it will return the server ID and the server's name so you can easily create a link to join the same server. I can imagine how nifty this would be if properly implemented in a clan form or something similar.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a title="BattlelogApi" href="http://www.blakeharley.com/projects/battlelogapi/">project page</a> to see the specifics and download the updated API.</p>
<p>Maybe this Battlelog thing isn't so bad after all?</p>
