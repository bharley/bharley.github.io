<p>As a self-titled <em>teevee</em> aficionado, the time would eventually come when I would need a nice, big TV. I used to rely on a TV that was on loan from a friend, but she reclaimed it a few weeks ago, and my HTPC has been rather lonely ever since.</p>
<p>To fill the void left by the recently departed 37" LCD, I bought a 42" Panasonic Plasma. The P42ST30. I was originally going to get a P46S30 (the non-3D, 46" version of the P42ST30), but after doing quite a bit of research on the matter it turns out that Panasonic puts higher quality display panels on their 3D TVs. I have no desire for 3D movies, but I do like my picture quality.</p>
<p>I like picture quality so much that I'm following the burn-in suggestions of some TV gurus. Basically, I'm running a specific set of slides for 100 hours to burn the plasma in evenly. When the TV is new, the plasma is a lot more active then it will be for the rest of its life. This burn-in process tries to curb any parts of the panel aging more rapidly in this crucial time period.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I now have to stare at a very nice TV for the next 100 hours while it only displays solid colors. I did sneak in 5 minutes of <em>The Dark Knight</em> before starting the burn-in---it was amazing. I can't wait to see what the picture looks like after I calibrate it.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/OOhWf.png" target="_blank">Here's a rather dull picture</a> of the new TV. Ignore the crappy image quality. I have a custom back plate on my iPhone which quickly filled the lens up with dust and dirt. I also plan on getting a proper media center going when I move in the fall.</p>
