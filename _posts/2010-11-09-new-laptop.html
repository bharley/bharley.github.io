<p>After my old, cheap laptop melted from almost four years of abuse, I was forced to purchase a new laptop. Instead of fooling myself into thinking that I wouldn't be tempted to play games on a laptop and subsequently melt it playing games, I decided to man up and buy a laptop that could game if I wanted to. I decided to go with one of the new Dell XPSes, the XPS 15.</p>
<p>While a game enthusiast would have picked a more sensible gaming machine, I picked the XPS with the idea that it would only be used for sparse gaming. I picked a machine with decent specs, portability and the ability to play games during vacations. Now I don't have to lug my desktop around when I visit the parents for a week. I'm really loving the HD screen. The 15" display has a 1920x1080 resolution—the same as my 23" monitors. And speakers are possibly the best I've ever heard from a laptop.</p>
<p>The battery life isn't superb, but with the 9-cell battery I upgraded to I get 5+ hours browsing the web. Thanks to NVIDIA Optimus, the GT420M graphics card lays dormant while the on-board integrated chip handles graphically minimal tasks—like browsing the web or programming. However, when I need the power I have a decent GPU at my fingertips. The GT420M might not be a powerhouse, but it allows me to play any modern game at medium settings or higher—even if I tend to opt for lower settings to keep heating at a minimum.</p>
<p>Overall, the "honeymoon period" has been very good—aside from the fact that Dell loads their machines with bloatware. But, I haven't even had the machine for 6 hours yet, so I haven't been able to put it through its paces. Here's hoping to continued smooth sailings.</p>
<p>P.S. I wish they didn't bother including McAfee.</p>
