<p>I fixed a small problem with BlakeTV that caused TV shows in a positive timezone <strong>*cough*</strong> Dr. Who <strong>*cough*</strong> to not format properly. Now silly Brit shows won't air every day.</p>
<p>On a related note, I'm planning on tackling BlakeTV one of these days. Update the backend, add new features, etc. Possibly even move it off to its own domain name. I'll probably start that project after finals.</p>
<p>Until then, BlakeTV should operate fine for the time being.</p>
<p>(<em>Wait... Does anyone else think it's weird that Dr. Who, a show about time travel and such, was giving me time zone issues?</em>)</p>
