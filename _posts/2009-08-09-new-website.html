<p>I had thought my previous host would last forever, but after almost four years of freeloading, they gave me the boot. ItÂ <em>might</em> of had something to do with a script I made that spammed the website with requests, but I can't guarantee anything...</p>
<p>For the time being, I'll be host jumping until I find something more permanent.</p>
<p>As for the new websites design, I've had this one on the back-burner for a while but haven't been motivated to changing it until now. As you can see, my current situation (and loss of the old database) has 'motivated' me.</p>
