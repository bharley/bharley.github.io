<p>Ever since the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (<strong>ICANN</strong>) announced that domain names will be allowed to include non-Latin characters come 2010, the internet has been in a flurry of joy, speculation and hate.</p>
<p>Some domain owners are now slightly confused though. Through the use of <strong>Punycode</strong> some people have been under the impression that they actually owned non-Latin domain names. Come 2010, however, they will notice their domain names will no longer work as they originally thought.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.blakeharley.com/???com">http://???com</a> <em>looks</em> like a domain name made out of non-Latin characters. Instead, a browser that understands <strong>Punycode</strong> converts those non-Latin characters into a<strong>UTF-8</strong> equivalent. That means that the domain above is actually registered as <a href="http://xn--xnrssu68j-189d.com/">http://xn—rssu68j.com</a>.</p>
<p>When browsers are finally updated to use the non-Latin characters instead of <strong>Punycode</strong>, whoever registered a domain name using <strong>Punycode</strong> will no longer get the traffic they wanted.</p>
<p>P.S. www.faceb��k.com anyone?</p>
