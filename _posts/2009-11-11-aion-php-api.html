<p>I created this API in the hopes of running a nice fansite or so behind it. But now I've quit Aion and don't really have any use for it. So I figure I'll just release what I have. I'm sure someone out there will find this useful.</p>
<p>Go to theÂ <a href="http://www.blakeharley.com/project/aionapi">Aion API</a> project page for more information, examples and a download link.</p>
<p>I am no longer developing this, so I will not be updating it any further. But if you have a question, leave a comment and I might be able to help.</p>
